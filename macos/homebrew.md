```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Add Homebrew to `PATH` (change the user name to yours):

```sh
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/unemotioned/.zprofile
&& eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

Or copy it from the installation prompt.

Check if installed:

```sh
brew --version
```

# install package
brew install {pkg}

# remove packages

## Pin Package Version

Keep `brew upgrade` from updating the package:

brew pin openjdk@17
```

Show the pinned packages with the `--pinned` flag:

```sh
brew list --pinned
```

Or list outdated packages before `upgrade`:

```sh
brew outdated
```

brew unpin openjdk@17
```

## Save Installed Packages

Create a `Brewfile` where the command was executed:

To install with a `Brewfile`, run from the `Brewfile` file path:

```sh
brew bundle install
```
